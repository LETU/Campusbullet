<h1>About the MasterList</h1>

<p>The MasterList was started in August 2010, when it was time to start 
purchasing textbooks.&nbsp; I wanted to look for used textbooks to buy from 
people, but soon discovered there was no centralized place to look for used 
books, other than bugging my friends and asking them if they had taken any of 
the classes I was about to.&nbsp; So, the MasterList was born (although it 
didn&#39;t get coded until that Christmas break).</p>
<p>For you computer geeks out there, the MasterList is built on Kohana, PHP, and 
MySQL running on Apache 2.2 on a linux box in a closet somewhere.</p>
