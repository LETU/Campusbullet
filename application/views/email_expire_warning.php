<h1>Hi from the Campus Bullet!</h1>
<p>Heads up! Your post, <a href="<?=$link_post?>"><?=$post_title?></a>, is about to expire!&nbsp; Unless you do something, it 
will disappear from the site in 3 days.&nbsp; You have two options:</p>
<p><strong>Option number 1:</strong> <a href="<?=$link_repost?>">Repost your 
listing to the top</a>.&nbsp;
The date on your post will be changed to today&#39;s date and it&#39;ll stay active for another 30 
days.&nbsp; This is the recommended option.</p>
<p><strong>Option number 2: </strong><a href="<?=$link_disable?>">Take the post 
down by disabling it</a>.&nbsp; You can re-enable it if you like at a later 
point.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t take the post down, we&#39;ll automatically disable it for 
you three days from now.</p>
<p>Thanks for using the Campus Bullet!</p>
