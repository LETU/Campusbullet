recovered, there is still hope :)</p>
<p>We&#39;re sorry we had to do this...this is more of a precaution than 
anything.&nbsp; Once you&#39;ve read over and <strong>made sure </strong>you are 
familiar with the <a href="<?=$url_base?>about/terms">terms of use</a>, write us back confirming that you&#39;ll be good.&nbsp; 
However, please note that <strong><span>any further abuse from 
this account will result in a permanent ban.</span></strong>&nbsp; But nobody 
wants a permanent ban, right? :)</p>
<p>This is the message you received from the moderator that disabled you:</p>

<p>We&#39;d love to have you back, so if you write us back at
<a href="mailto:accounts@campusbullet.net">accounts@campusbullet.net</a>, we&#39;ll 
get you fixed up.&nbsp; See you soon!</p>
