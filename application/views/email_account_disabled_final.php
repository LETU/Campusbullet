<h1>Hi from The Campus Bullet!</h1>
<p>Due to repeated abuse from this account, we have decided to <strong>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">permanently ban your account</span></strong>.&nbsp; 
We wish we didn&#39;t have to do this, but you left us no choice.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>Usually, bans like this can&#39;t be repealed.&nbsp; However, if you feel you&#39;ve 
been wrongly banned, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:accounts@campusbullet.net">
accounts@campusbullet.net</a>.</p>
<p>This is the message you received from the moderator that banned you:</p>
<pre><?=$message?></pre>
<p>Sorry...this hurts us way more than this hurts you (although you probably 
already knew that).</p>
