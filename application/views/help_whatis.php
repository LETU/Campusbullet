<h1>What is the MasterList?</h1>
<p>The MasterList is a craigslist-style bulletin board system
for posting up stuff you want to sell to other students, like textbooks for example.&nbsp; It's totally free and pretty simple to use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">How does it work?</span>&nbsp; Post an item up by entering a few short details.&nbsp; After posting the item and
 someone sees it, they'll send you an email through the site regarding the item.&nbsp; You'll respond to the email through your inbox.&nbsp; After
 you've sold the item, just take it down and you'll stop receiving emails regarding it.&nbsp; Pretty simple, right? </p>
<p>Also, you should know that use of the service is <strong>at your own risk</strong> 
and you actually have to meet whoever you&#39;re selling stuff to in person, which 
will take social skills.&nbsp; You have been warned.</p>
